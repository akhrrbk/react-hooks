# react-hooks

different practices have been experimented. 

App.js index.js and css files stayed the same
1. if you look at src/components folder there are folders of JS files. 
2. go to the folder in your console. type 'npm start'. 
3. open the App.js folder
4. import any of the files
5. check out these small projects individually
